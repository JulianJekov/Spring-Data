# üìö Spring Data - –§–µ–≤—Ä—É–∞—Ä–∏ 2024

## üéì Course Overview
In the **Spring Data** course, participants will explore the details of working with Hibernate, a modern ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) technology that is practically the standard for ORM in Java applications. Hibernate facilitates mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented model (Java classes) using both "database first" and "code first" approaches. It provides a powerful object-oriented API for database queries and CRUD operations from Java. 

**Spring Data** further enhances the standard API by providing an additional layer of abstraction and an easy way to handle data from the database. The course will demonstrate best practices for building the database layer of complex systems in Java applications using built-in implementations of the Repository pattern and the Service Layer, as well as importing and exporting data in different formats (JSON, XML).
